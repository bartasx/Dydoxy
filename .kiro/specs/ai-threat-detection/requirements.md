# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Threat Detection system is a critical security component for the Dydoxy proxy management platform. This feature will enhance the existing content filtering engine with machine learning capabilities to detect and block sophisticated threats in real-time. The system will analyze network traffic patterns, content characteristics, and behavioral indicators to identify malicious activities, advanced persistent threats, and zero-day exploits that traditional signature-based systems might miss.

The system builds upon the existing content filtering infrastructure and integrates with the current rate limiting and security modules to provide comprehensive protection for enterprise proxy users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want an AI-powered threat detection system that can identify sophisticated attacks in real-time, so that I can protect my organization from advanced threats that bypass traditional security measures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network traffic passes through the proxy THEN the system SHALL analyze content using machine learning models for threat detection
2. WHEN a threat is detected with confidence above 80% THEN the system SHALL block the connection and log the incident
3. WHEN a threat is detected THEN the system SHALL generate a security alert with threat classification and confidence score
4. WHEN analyzing traffic THEN the system SHALL process requests within 50ms to maintain proxy performance
5. IF the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to signature-based detection without service interruption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the threat detection system to learn from new attack patterns and adapt automatically, so that protection improves over time without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new threat patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL update the ML model with new training data
2. WHEN false positives are reported THEN the system SHALL incorporate feedback to improve model accuracy
3. WHEN the model is retrained THEN the system SHALL validate performance before deploying updates
4. WHEN model updates are available THEN the system SHALL apply them during maintenance windows without downtime
5. IF model performance degrades below 85% accuracy THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and revert to previous version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want detailed threat intelligence reporting and audit trails, so that I can demonstrate security compliance and investigate security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threats are detected THEN the system SHALL log detailed information including threat type, confidence score, and remediation actions
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide threat statistics, trends, and risk assessments
3. WHEN a security incident occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain complete audit trails for forensic analysis
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support standard formats (JSON, CSV, SIEM integration)
5. IF data retention policies are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or purge old threat data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want configurable threat detection policies and response actions, so that I can customize security controls based on organizational risk tolerance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring policies THEN the system SHALL allow setting different threat thresholds per organization or user group
2. WHEN threats are detected THEN the system SHALL support multiple response actions (block, quarantine, alert-only, rate-limit)
3. WHEN managing policies THEN the system SHALL provide a web interface for policy configuration and testing
4. WHEN policies change THEN the system SHALL apply updates in real-time without service restart
5. IF conflicting policies exist THEN the system SHALL apply the most restrictive policy and log the conflict

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive APIs for threat detection integration, so that I can build custom security applications and integrate with existing security tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing threat data THEN the system SHALL provide REST APIs for threat queries and policy management
2. WHEN integrating with SIEM systems THEN the system SHALL support webhook notifications for real-time alerts
3. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL provide SDK libraries for Go and .NET integration
4. WHEN using APIs THEN the system SHALL enforce authentication and rate limiting for security
5. IF API schemas change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide migration guides

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want behavioral analysis capabilities that can detect anomalous user activities and insider threats, so that I can identify sophisticated attacks that don't match known signatures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access resources THEN the system SHALL build behavioral profiles based on access patterns, timing, and locations
2. WHEN anomalous behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL calculate risk scores and trigger appropriate responses
3. WHEN analyzing behavior THEN the system SHALL consider contextual factors like time of day, location, and device characteristics
4. WHEN behavioral thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with detailed behavioral analysis
5. IF user behavior changes significantly THEN the system SHALL adapt baselines while maintaining security controls

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want real-time monitoring and alerting for the threat detection system itself, so that I can ensure the security infrastructure is operating correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide health metrics including model performance, processing latency, and error rates
2. WHEN system performance degrades THEN it SHALL generate operational alerts with severity levels
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL expose metrics via Prometheus endpoints for integration with monitoring tools
4. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL support multiple notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
5. IF critical components fail THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup systems and notify operators
